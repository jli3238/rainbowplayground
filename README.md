Be a good citizen to yourself and other code reviewers üòç
- Make your PRs as small and objective as possible
- No more than one ticket per PR
- Avoid PRs bigger than **15** files
  - It makes the reviewer's job harder
  - If this happens we can split stories into sub-tasks in order to facilitate the reviewer's job

## Deploy your project
```sh
npm run build
```
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
